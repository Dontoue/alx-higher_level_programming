# Python - import & modules
In this project, I learned about importing and using functions and creating modules in Python. I further practiced using the builtin function dir() and using command line arguments within Python programs.

# Tasks 📃

• 0. Import a simple function from a simple file

	° 0-add.py: Python program that imports the function def add(a, b): from the file add_0.py and prints the result of the addition 1 + 2 = 3.
	° Output: <a value> + <b value> = <add(a, b) value> followed by a new line.

• 1. My first toolbox!

	° 1-calculation.py: Python program that imports functions from the file calculator_1.py and prints the result of the addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of 10 and 5.
	° Output: <a value> <operator> <b value> = <operation(a, b) value> followed by a new line.

• 2. How to make a script dynamic!

	° 2-args.py: Python program that prints the number of and list of its arguments.
	° Output: [Number of arguments] argument (if number is one) or arguments (otherwise), followed by:
	° : (or . if no argumets were passed), followed by
	° A new line, followed by
	° One argument per line - the position of the argument (starting at 1) followed by : followed by the argument value and another new line.

• 3. Infinite addition

	° 3-infinite_add.py: Python program that prints the result of the addition of all arguments.
	° Output: Sum of the arguments followed by a new line.

• 4. Who are you?

	° 4-hidden_discovery.py: Python program that prints all the names defined by the compiled module hidden_4.pyc.
	° Output: One name per line in alphabetical order.
	° Names starting with __ are not printed.
• 5. Everything can be imported

	° 5-variable_load.py: Python program that imorts the variable a from the file variable_load_5.py and prints its value.

• 6. Build my own calculator!

	° 100-my_calculator.py: Python program that imports all functions from the file calculator_1.py and handles basic operations.
	° Usage: ./100-my_calculator.py <a> <operator> <b> followed by a new line.
	° Output: <a> <operator> <b> = <result> followed by a new line.
	° The parameter operator can be:
		° + for addition
		° - for subtraction
		° * for multiplication
		° / for division
	° If the operator is none of the above, the function prints Unknown operator. Available operators: +, -, *, and / followed by a new line and exits with a status value of 1.
	° If the number of arguments is not three, the program prints Usage: ./100-my_calculator.py <a> <operator> <b> followed by a new line and exits with a status value of 1.

• 7. Easy print

	° 101-easy_print.py: Python program that prints #pythoniscool followed by a new line in the standard output.
	° Without using print, eval, open, or sys.

• 8. ByteCode -> Python #3

	° 102-magic_calculation.py: Python function matching exactly a bytecode provided by Holberton School.

• 9. Fast alphabet

	° 103-fast_alphabet.py: Python program that prints the alphabet in uppercase, followed by a new line.
	° Without using loops, conditoinals, str.join(), string literals, or system calls.
