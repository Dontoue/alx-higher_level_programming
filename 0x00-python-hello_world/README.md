## Python - Hello, World
In this project, I began practicing using the interpreter, printing text and variables, and indexing and slicing strings in Python.

## Tests âœ”ï¸

	Â°Completion of this source code.

â€¢7. Copy - Cut - Paste

	Â°7-edges.py: Python script that sets three string variables based on the string contained in the variable word as follows:
	Â°word_first_3: Contains the first three letters of the variable word.
	Â°word_last_2: Contains the last two letters of the variable word.
	Â°middle_word: Contains the value of the variable word without the first and last letters.
	Â°Completion of this source code.

â€¢8. Create a new sentence

	Â°8-concat_edges.py: Python script that prints object-oriented programming with Python, followed by a new line without creating new variables or string literals.
	Â°Completion of this source code.

â€¢9. Easter Egg

	Â°9-easter_egg.py: Python script that prints "The Zen of Python" by Tim Peters, followed by a new line.

â€¢10. Linked list cycle

	Â°10-check_cycle.c: C function that checks if a linked list contains a cycle.
	Â°Returns 0 if there is no cycle and 1 if there is.
Helper files:
	Â°linked_lists.c: C functions handling linked lists for testing 10-check_cycle.c (provided by Holberton School).
	Â°lists.h: Header file containing definitions and prototypes for all types and functions used in linked_lists.c and 10-check_cycle.c.

â€¢11. Hello, write

	Â°100-write.py: Python script that prints exactly and that piece of art is useful - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19, followed by a new line to stderr using the function write from the sys module.
Exits with a status code of 1.

â€¢12. Compile

	Â°101-compile: Python script that compiles a Python script file stored in the environment variable $PYFILE and saves it to an output file $PYFILEc (ex. export PYFILE=my_main.py => output filename: my_main.pyc).

â€¢13. ByteCode -> Python #1

	Â°102-magic_calculation.py: Python function matching exactly a bytecode provided by Holberton School.
